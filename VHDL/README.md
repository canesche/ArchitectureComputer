# History

According to book Digital Design and Computer Architecture - Harris & Harris 2nd edition:
 
VHDL is an acronym for the VHSIC Hardware Description
Language. VHSIC is in turn an acronym for the Very High Speed
Integrated Circuits program of the US Department of Defense.
VHDL was originally developed in 1981 by the Department
of Defense to describe the structure and function of hardware. Its
roots draw from the Ada programming language. The language
was first envisioned for documentation but was quickly adopted
for simulation and synthesis. The IEEE standardized it in 1987
and has updated the standard several times since. This chapter
is based on the 2008 revision of the VHDL standard (IEEE
STD 1076-2008), which streamlines the language in a variety
of ways. At the time of this writing, not all of the VHDL 2008
features are supported by CAD tools; this chapter only uses
those understood by Synplicity, Altera Quartus, and ModelSim.
VHDL file names normally end in .vhd.
