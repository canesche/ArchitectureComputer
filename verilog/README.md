# History

According to book Digital Design and Computer Architecture - Harris & Harris 2nd edition:
 
Verilog was developed by Gateway Design Automation as a
proprietary language for logic simulation in 1984. Gateway
was acquired by Cadence in 1989 and Verilog was made an
open standard in 1990 under the control of Open Verilog
International. The language became an IEEE standard 1 in
1995. The language was extended in 2005 to streamline idio-
syncracies and to better support modeling and verification of
systems. These extensions have been merged into a single lan-
guage standard, which is now called SystemVerilog (IEEE STD
1800-2009). SystemVerilog file names normally end in .sv.
